		<h2>Badminton üè∏ </h2>
    	<p>I started this sport when I was 6, during primaray school : I do remember the feeling of joy that apprears when I was on court. I was used to playing every day, even twice. From 2011 till 2016, I was selecrted in the French team for several international tournaments (Denmark, Sweeden, Germany, Switzerland). At this part of my life, I have realized that I had a real good potential. It wasn't only playing and training; it was something bigger, something huge, it was a passion, my passion! My coach, my friends and my family were behind my every single day. I have won two medals at the French Junior Championships with a gold one. And now on, I still keep playing at a high level but with only two trainings a week. </p>

		<h3> Volley ball üèê </h3>
    	<p> I have been playing volley ball for four or five years with my family. Indeed, volley ball is my family's sport; all my cousins, siblings, oncles practice this sport. So, thanks to them, I have started to enjoy and play more and more. When we are together, we always have a ball to play volley (in the street, the woods or along the beach). During summer holidays, we play beach volley all the afternoons, with memorable sportive moments that would remain a very long time in my memory! 
    	Moreover, I was selected in the first team of my school EMLV for the University competitions.   </p>

		<h4> Trips üåç </h4>
    	<p>I had the chance to travel all around the world. It was an opportinity to visit some places which were doomed to disappear. I have met wonderful people, discovered new cultures and seen a lot of wonderful landscapes. <br>
